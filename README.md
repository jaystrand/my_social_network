## Description

A social network is an online platform that connects people, allowing them to share information, ideas, and experiences in real time. Users can create profiles, build connections, and interact through posts, messages, and multimedia content. Social networks foster communities, facilitate communication, and enable businesses and individuals to engage with a global audience.

## Usage
To use a social network, begin by setting up a profile. Connect with others by adding friends, following accounts, or joining groups. Share updates, photos, or videos to express yourself or highlight your activities. Interact by reacting to other's comments or highlights.
